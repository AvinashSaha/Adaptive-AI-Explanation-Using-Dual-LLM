      A research prototype that delivers transparent, dual‑LLM health information
      with explicit verification and evidence‑linked explanations.

      This web application is part of an academic study on AI‑assisted healthcare
      decision support. It uses two large language models: the first generates an
      initial answer and the second independently reviews, critiques, and refines
      that answer, highlighting uncertainties and citing peer‑reviewed sources.
